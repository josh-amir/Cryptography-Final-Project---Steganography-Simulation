# Cryptography-Final-Project---Steganography-Simulation
This is our final project for Cryptography and Network Security Course and Web Systems course, creating  a Stegonography Simulation
# Instructions

Steganography Simulation: “Hidden Secrets”
Objective: Demonstrate Digital Watermarking through Steganography.
Detailed Instructions:
• Create an interactive simulation website that allows users to:
  1. Upload an image (e.g., .jpg, .png)
  2. Input a watermark text (e.g., author name, ID, or copyright note)
  3. Embed (hide) the watermark into the image
  4. Reveal or extract the watermark later
• Include side-by-side comparison:
  o Original image
  o Watermarked image
• Add a short section explaining real-world uses of digital watermarking (e.g., protecting artworks, verifying ownership).

#Expected Output:
An interactive demonstration of how digital watermarking works using steganography principles.
